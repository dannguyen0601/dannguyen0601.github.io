        <!--About my career path-->
        <p>
            I was a <strong>Senior Account Executive</strong> in one <em>Digital Marketing Agency</em> in Vietnam, but then I realized after 2 years that the toxic environment didn't fit me well, I just don't feel satisfied enough, because I cannot be myself. <br>My <em>creativity</em> was locked then. I forgot how much I love to create things. So I decided to quit. <br>Then I started to be a Freelancer, doing <strong>Content Marketing</strong> and also, I tried in a new field- <strong>Video Production</strong> as an<strong>Assistant Director</strong> and I realize I also passionate in Video Production. <br> Being an Assistant Director helps me to visualize about every position and their responsibility in the crew, to think more about what I really like and want to do more in the future. I want to be an <strong>Art Director </strong> and I will strengthen my skills and try my best to achieve my dream. <br> If not, I would like to be a <strong> Freelance artist</strong>
